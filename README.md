# Data-Challenge-UMDOTS-
Repo for UMD Data Science Challenge

### Description
This project is my entry for the 2021 UMD Data Challenge. The dataset comprises 62 days (October 2020 and October 2019) of historical data, to include ride counts, event times, trips, routes, and status changes. No personally identifiable information from riders and member accounts is included. The dataset is an anonymized dataset. 

### Background
The company that provides the e-scooter service in the UMD area, VeoRide Inc., is a mobility service provider that manages their micro mobility fleet through the use of the Mobility Data Standard (MDS). Data generated from individual e-scooters and stored in VeoRideâ€™s computers contain the information necessary for this study. 

### Objectives
I completed several task to extract information used for later exploratory analysis. These tasks include:
* Task 1: Making sense of the coordinates (plotting coordinates on Google Maps)
* Task 2: Find rides that are on/off campus
* Task 3: Create datetime columns
Once I completed these tasks, I was able to find patterns that reveal trends in ride activity.
