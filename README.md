# Data-Challenge-UMDOTS-
Repo for UMD Data Science Challenge

### Description
This project is my entry for the 2021 UMD Data Challenge. The dataset comprises 62 days (October 2020 and October 2019) of historical data, to include ride counts, event times, trips, routes, and status changes. No personally identifiable information from riders and member accounts is included. The dataset is an anonymized dataset.
